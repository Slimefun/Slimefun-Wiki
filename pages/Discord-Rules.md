If you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/fsD4Bkh), then we want you to follow these rules.<br>
Not following this ruleset can result in us banning you from the server.

**These rules can change at any time, so please check these regularly. Large changes will be announced of course.**

## General Rules
These rules apply to **any** channel on the server.

### 1. No Harassment
Do not harass or insult other users.<br>
Feel free to swear as long as you don't insult people to purposefully hurt them.

### 2. No Discrimination
No racism, no sexism, no discrimination of any kind!

### 3. No Nudity or other inappropriate images
You are not allowed to post any nude content or other inappropriate images (e.g. symbols of hate or discrimination).<br>
Same applies for profile pictures or custom statuses.

We may ban you for inappropriate profile pictures or custom statuses.

### 4. Don't argue with members of staff
If we tell you to stop something, stop it.<br>
You should have read these rules before-hand, you can feel free to ask a question about these rules, if they are unclear.<br>
But arguing with our staff will be a waste of time.

### 5. Stay on-topic!
Every channel has a specified topic.
* Questions about Slimefun? #questions
* You have a suggestion? #suggestions
* You want to talk about a Slimefun Addon? Try to go to one of the addons' channels or #other-addons
* Found a weird bug that you wanna discuss to see if others experience the same? #bug-discussions
* For any conversations unrelated to Slimefun, go to #offtopic

### 6. Don't tag people
Do **NOT** tag someone to just to get their attention.<br>
Even more important: Do **NOT** tag members of staff just to draw their attention...<br>
You shouldn't directly message a member of staff either unless they explicitly told you to.<br>
Our Staff is not your personal 24/7 support hotline, they have better things to do.

If you are in a crowded conversation and it wouldn't be clear who you are responding to, then you may tag someone to clarify that you're replying to that person.

Tagging entire groups of people is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED**.<br>
We may tag everyone on the Server for important announcements though, we try to keep that to a minimum though.

### 7. No Spam
Do **NOT** spam messages.<br>
Write one proper message instead of a dozen short ones.<br>
Excessive use of caps is also not allowed.

### 8. No Advertisement
You are **NOT** allowed to advertise products on this discord server.<br>
You are **NOT** allowed to post links to other discord servers.<br>
You are **NOT** allowed to promote a fundraising campaign or any other means to collect money.<br>
Raising awareness for charity or non-profit-organizations is allowed if approved by an Admin.

Advertising Minecraft Servers is allowed, but **ONLY** in #server-recommendations<br>
IPs to Minecraft Servers are not allowed to be posted in any other channel.

### 9. English Only
Please speak english on our discord, as that is the main language of this plugin.

### 10. Other
The staff at their own discretion if there be a need can take appropriate action. Please have some common sense and general respect if you wish to not fall under this rule.

## Channel-specific Rules
These are short explanations of some of our channels, they also outline some of the DOs and DON'Ts.

### #welcome
This channel is **ONLY** for saying "hi" and "welcome" to people.<br>
Any other form of conversation should move to the appropriate channel as soon as possible.

### #general-discussions
This channel is for general discussions around Slimefun, questions should still go to #questions.

### #offtopic
This channel is for any conversations that are not about Slimefun.

### #suggestions
This channel is for suggesting stuff that should be added to Slimefun or for addon ideas.<br>
If your suggestion reaches a certain amount of upvotes within a week, or one of our admins really likes your idea, then it will be moved to #approved-suggestions.
If your suggestion is too broadly worded or reaches a lot of downvotes, it will be automatically deleted.

Try to make your suggestion as detailed as possible.<br>
"add more X" or any other suggestion that is deemed "too short" is not a helpful suggestion and may be deleted by our staff.

Try to fit your suggestion into a single message, edit your message if you forgot something.<br>
Also: Do not post multiple suggestions within the same message.<br>
Only **ONE** message per suggestion, not more or less, otherwise our suggestions-bot will be confused.<br>
Do **NOT** post follow-up suggestions, each suggestion should be independent from another, try to contact the author of the earlier suggestion and ask him to edit his suggestion instead.

### #server-recommendations
This channel is for advertising your Minecraft Server.<br>
Your Server must be publicly accessible (no whitelist) and must have Slimefun installed.<br>
The same Server must not be posted again within 14 days, otherwise we will delete your post as a duplicate.<br>
You are NOT allowed to post a link to your discord server.

### #bug-disccussions
This channel is only for discussions around bugs, **not for reporting them.**<br>
For reporting bugs, please consult [How to report bugs](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/How-to-report-bugs).

Before posting here, please follow this short guide:<br>
1. Run `/sf versions`
2. Capture the output of that command and include it in your message.
3. Are there any errors? If so, then post them via https://pastebin.com (Posting an error in the chat will result in auto-deletion)
4. See if there are newer versions of Slimefun and CS-CoreLib available. (https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/)
5. Try to be as clear as possible, minimum is two sentences. ("X does not work" is not helpful)
6. Double-check that you are using a "DEV - ..." build of Slimefun and CS-CoreLib, other builds are considered old or unofficial. **We will not accept bug reports from old or unofficial versions, RC versions will also be rejected since they are outdated.**

For more info on how to debug your issues and make proper bug reports, please read [How to report bugs](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/How-to-report-bugs).

### #questions
This is our main support channel, if you have a question, then come here to ask it.<br>
Note that questions about addons should rather be asked in their respective channel.

### #programming-help
This channel is for anyone who is interested in developing Slimefun, addons or any other sort of programs.<br>
You can ask for help on your addon, ask about Slimefun's API or how to do stuff in Java.<br>
We may even help you with your private programming questions, if we are in the mood for it.
