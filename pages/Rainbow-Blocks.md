- Rainbow Concrete
- Rainbow Terracotta
- Rainbow Wool

## Obtaining
These items are part of the [Magical Gadgets](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Gadgets) category. Their exact recipes can be found in-game.  
Do note that these also exist for specific seasons (eg. Halloween Rainbow blocks). These can be found in their corresponding [Seasonal Categories](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Seasonal-Categories).

## Usage & Specifications
These blocks will cycle through all the colours in which they can possibly come.  
When placed, all blocks of the same type (eg. all Rainbow Wool blocks) will synchronize and display the same colour.  
This does not happen between two types (eg. Rainbow wool and Rainbow glass).

When you break any of these items with any tool, they will drop back the original Rainbow version (this includes glass and glass panes).
