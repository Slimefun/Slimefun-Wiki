The Electric Furnace is a Machine in the [Electric Machines](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) category. It looks like a regular furnace and acts like regular furnaces except it uses electricity rather than other conventional fuel like wood and coal.

## Obtaining

The Electric Furnace is crafted in the [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table). The recipes vary with the machine levels and can be found in the Slimefun guide. The Electric Furnace comes in three tiers



## Usage

The Electric Furnaces has to be connected to an [Electrical Network](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) with sufficient energy to function. 

All three levels of the Electric Furnace have the same layout

And the slots of an Electric Furnace III is shown below:  
![Electric Furnace III Slots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Slimefun/Slimefun-Wiki/master/images/electric-furnace.png)

- The two cyan glass panes on the left are the input slots 
- The orange slots on the right are the output slots which items will appear after they've been processed 

Once the output slots are filled, the Electric Furnaces stops its operation until the output slots are cleared. Therefore, a [Cargo Management System](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Management) is the most efficient way to control the input and output to make an automated system
