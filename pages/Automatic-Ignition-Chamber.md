The Automatic Ignition Chamber is part of the [Basic Machines](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Basic-Machines) category.  

## Usage
The Automatic Ignition Chamber can only be used as an extension on the smeltery.  
You just put it next to the dispenser of the smeltery and fill it with flint and steel, and it will automatically lit up the smeltery.
