The Lava Generator is a type of [electricity](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) generator. There are currently two tiers of lava generators.

## Obtaining
All tiers of lava generators can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage
A lava generator must be placed within 7 blocks of an [energy regulator](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Regulator) or a [capacitor](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Capacitors) in range of one (in a straight line; no diagonals), and provided with the appropriate fuel.<br>
Once it is placed, right-click it and place fuel in its inventory (two slots on the left).

## Tiers
The table below compares the two tiers of lava generators.

| Tier | Energy | Buffer |
| ---- | --- | ------ |
| I | 20 J/s | 512 J |
| II | 40 J/s | 1024 J |

## Fuel
This generator can be only fueled with lava buckets.

| Fuel | Burning time | Total (Tier I) | Total (Tier II) |
| ---- | ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Lava Bucket | 40s |  800 J | 1.6 kJ |
