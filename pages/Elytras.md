The Elytra Scale is a crafting component, while the other three are usable elytras.

| Item | Specialities |
| ---- | -------- |
| Elytra | N/A |
| Infused Elytra | comes with mending |
| Soulbound Elytra | kept on death |


Fun fact: these were implemented due to the fact that big servers run out of elytras quick, and it only became harder and harder for new players to obtain them.
