The Energy and Electricity category adds various machines which generate, consume or transfer energy (measured in Joules or J). It also includes [programmable androids](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Androids), which can be programmed to execute a series of tasks.

An energy network begins with an [Energy Regulator](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Regulator): without it, power transfer can not happen.<br>
You will also need some way to generate electricity to power your machines, and possibly [capacitors](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Capacitors) to store energy and extend the range of your network.

Some machines have a buffer, meaning they can store a certain amount of energy. Unlike capacitors, however, if such a machine receives insufficient power, the stored energy will be lost over time.

Electric machines are best used with a [Cargo Management System](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Management) for automatic item transportation.
