Soulbound Backpack is a variant on the Woven [Backpack](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Backpacks).

It has 36 Inventory Slots and it will be kept when you die, just like all other Soulbound Items.  
It only has 36 Inventory Slots which is 18 less than the Gilded [Backpack](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Backpacks), however, it is kept upon death which is why some people prefer it.
