The Auto Enchanter is an [Electric Machine](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) which can be used to add Enchanted Books to tools and weapons.

Together with the [Auto Disenchanter](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Auto-Disenchanter) you can use this to disenchant [Reinforced Armor](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Reinforced-Armor) to obtain Protection IX and Unbreaking IX books and put those on diamond or netherite gear.
